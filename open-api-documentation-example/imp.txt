Then when we run our application, the OpenAPI descriptions will be available at the path /v3/api-docs by default:

http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs/
To use a custom path, we can indicate in the application.properties file:

springdoc.api-docs.path=/api-docs
Now we'll be able to access the docs at:

http://localhost:8080/api-docs/
The OpenAPI definitions are in JSON format by default. For yaml format, we can obtain the definitions at:

http://localhost:8080/api-docs.yaml

Now we can access the API documentation at:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


For example, let's customize the path of our API documentation. We can do this by modifying our application.properties to include:

springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui-custom.html
So now our API documentation will be available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui-custom.html.

As another example, to sort the API paths in order of their HTTP methods, we can add:

springdoc.swagger-ui.operationsSorter=method
